"it 's tricky with this implementation because we ca n't rely on any state in between two calls to setcharacter since the caller might modify the terminal 's state outside of this writer . however , many calls inside textgraphics will indeed make multiple calls in setcharacter where we know that the state wo n't change ( actually , we ca n't be 100 % sure since the caller might create a separate thread and maliciously write directly to the terminal while call one of the draw/fill/put methods in here ) . we could just set the state before writing every single character but that would be inefficient . rather , we keep a counter of if we are inside an 'atomic ' ( meaning we know multiple calls to setcharacter will have the same state ) . some drawing methods call other drawing methods internally for their implementation so that 's why this is implemented with an integer value instead of a boolean ; when the counter reaches zero we remove the memory of what state the terminal is in ."

"causes current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the method or the method for this object , or a specified amount of time has elapsed . the current thread must own this object 's monitor . this method causes the current thread ( call it t ) to place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish any and all synchronization claims on this object . thread t becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four things happens : some other thread invokes the notify method for this object and thread t happens to be arbitrarily chosen as the thread to be awakened . some other thread invokes the notifyall method for this object . some other thread interrupts thread t. the specified amount of real time has elapsed , more or less . if timeout is zero , however , then real time is not taken into consideration and the thread simply waits until notified . the thread t is then removed from the wait set for this object and re-enabled for thread scheduling . it then competes in the usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the object ; once it has gained control of the object , all its synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo ante - that is , to the situation as of the time that the wait method was invoked . thread t then returns from the invocation of the wait method . thus , on return from the wait method , the synchronization state of the object and of thread t is exactly as it was when the wait method was invoked . if the current thread is interrupted by another thread while it is waiting , then an interruptedexception is thrown . this exception is not thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as described above . note that the wait method , as it places the current thread into the wait set for this object , unlocks only this object ; any other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain locked while the thread waits . this method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object 's monitor . see the notify method for a description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of a monitor ."

"creates a string representation of the double argument . all characters mentioned below are ascii characters . if the argument is nan , the result is the string `` nan '' . otherwise , the result is a string that represents the sign and magnitude ( absolute value ) of the argument . if the sign is negative , the first character of the result is '- ' ( '- ' ) ; if the sign is positive , no sign character appears in the result . as for the magnitude : if is infinity , it is represented by the characters `` infinity '' ; thus , positive infinity produces the result `` infinity '' and negative infinity produces the result `` -infinity '' . if is zero , it is represented by the characters `` 0.0 '' ; thus , negative zero produces the result `` -0.0 '' and positive zero produces the result `` 0.0 '' . if is greater than or equal to 10-3 but less than 107 , then it is represented as the integer part of , in decimal form with no leading zeroes , followed by ' .
